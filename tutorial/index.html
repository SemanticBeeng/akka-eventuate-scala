    <h2>eventuate tutorial</h2>
    <p>
    This tutorial guides you through a distributed order management application
    based on <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/">eventuate</a> by
    using distributed and
    <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event-sourced</a>
    order-actors. It
    demonstrates the most important parts of such an application and how to build
    one yourself. The
    <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/example-application.html#example-application">example</a>
    is actually taken from the eventuate project itself
    and only modified slightly to allow better integration into an activator template.
    </p><p>
    The application
    runs an OrderManager on several nodes. Each one is able to accept
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>new oders</li>
    <li>new oder items for an existing order</li>
    <li>cancellation of orders</li>
    <li>removal of items from an existing oder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The changes are replicated to all connected nodes. Changing the same order on
    multiple nodes concurrently is considered a conflict. In that case
    multiple versions of this order are maintained until one is picked <em>interactively</em>
    to resolve the conflict.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The application: OrderLocation</h2>

    <p>
        The entry into the application is
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderLocation.scala" class="shortcut">OrderLocation</a>.
        It starts the actor-system and the actors
        <code>OrderManager</code> as well as <code>OrderView</code> in the
        akka-typical manner. What makes it an eventuate-based application that supports distributed
        deployment is the
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/latest/api/index.html#com.rbmhtechnology.eventuate.ReplicationEndpoint">ReplicationEndpoint</a>.
        This takes care of replicating changes to all connected <code>ReplicationEndpoint</code>s.
        A <code>ReplicationEndpoint</code> can either be setup programmatically or (as in this case) by
        <a href="#code/src/main/resources/location-C.conf" class="shortcut">configuration</a>. For this on each <em>node</em>
        akka-remoting
        host and port (under which this <code>RelicationEndpoint</code> is available) needs to be defined:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
akka.remote.netty.tcp.hostname = "127.0.0.1"
akka.remote.netty.tcp.port=2554
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        as well as an endpoint-id and the replication-partners on the other nodes:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
eventuate {
  endpoint.id = "C"
  endpoint.connections = ["127.0.0.1:2552", "127.0.0.1:2553", "127.0.0.1:2555"]
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        So in this case <code>ReplicationEndpoint</code> C listens on 127.0.0.1:2554 and connects to
        <code>ReplicationEndpoint</code>s on <em>other nodes</em> listening on
        127.0.0.1:2552, 127.0.0.1:2553 and 127.0.0.1:2555.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The order manager</h2>

    <p>
    At the heart of the application is the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderManager.scala" class="shortcut">OrderManager</a>.
    It is implemented as
    <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/latest/api/index.html#com.rbmhtechnology.eventuate.EventsourcedView">EventsourcedView</a>
    to better illustrate how orders are created in the distributed system. For the moment
    it is enough to assume that it is a plain actor and its <code>onCommand</code> method is actually the
    <code>receive</code> method of an actor.
    </p><p>
    Its main purpose is to maintain a <code>Map</code> of
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderActor.scala" class="shortcut">OrderActors</a>
    by id each one representing a specific
    order and dispatch <code>OrderCommand</code>s or a <code>Resolve</code>-command to them
    (to modify the order) or a <code>SaveSnapshot</code>-command for taking a
    <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/reference/event-sourcing.html#snapshots">snapshot</a>
    of the internal state of an order.
    Additionally it allows to retrieve the current state of all orders (currently in memory).
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The order-actor</h2>

    <p>
        A single order is represented by an
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderActor.scala" class="shortcut">OrderActor</a>.
        It is implemented as an
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/latest/api/index.html#com.rbmhtechnology.eventuate.EventsourcedActor">EventsourcedActor</a>.
        It represents a special case of an
        <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html">aggregate root</a>
        and that is why it defines
        the member <code>aggregateId</code>. This has to be an application wide unique id.
        Even eventsourced aggregate roots of different type must not share the same ids.
        In addition to this it defines the members <code>id</code> and <code>eventLog</code>.
        <code>id</code> must be a globally unique id, so all other <code>EventsourcedActor</code>s or even
        <code>EventsourcedView</code>s in the entire distributed setup must not share this id. Here it
        is built as combination of <code>replicaId</code> that
        identifies a node or location and <code>orderId</code>. The idea is that there are several <code>OrderActor</code>-instances
        with the same <code>orderId</code> (respectively <code>aggregateId</code>)
        at different nodes (and thus with different <code>replicaId</code>) and state-changes to one of them are replicated to the
        others so that they are eventually all in the same state.
        For this an
        <code>EventsourcedActor</code> defines the two methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>onCommand</code></li>
        <li><code>onEvent</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The purpose of <code>onCommand</code> is to process commands (of type
        <code>OrderCommand</code>) that sre sent to change
        the state of the order (like <code>AddOrderItem</code>) by
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>verifying that the command is valid and can be accepted and in case it is</li>
        <li>emitting an event (or multiple) that describes the state-change (by calling <code>persist(event)</code>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So for example if an <code>AddOrderItem</code>-command can be accepted the
        <code>onCommand</code>-handler emits an <code>OrderItemAdded</code>-event.
        Before this event is processed by the <code>onEvent</code>-handler to
        perform the requested state-change, it is persisted by eventuate to the
        event-log (represented by the member <code>eventLog</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
        This reflects the core principle of eventsourced applications. Instead of
        persisting the current state, state-changes are persisted. When the application (or just the actor)
        is restarted all persisted events are replayed (i.e. the <code>onEvent</code>-handler
        is called for each of them) to reconstruct the state as before.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that <code>onCommand</code> and <code>onEvent</code> are both called during normal
        actor message dispatch so they can safely access and modify an actor's mutable state,
        however as persisting is done asynchronously they are not invoked through a single message.
        Nonetheless eventuate guarantees by default that no new command slips between an
        <code>onCommand</code>-call and the <code>onEvent</code>-calls for each emitted/persisted
        event by stashing commands that arrive in the meantime. This guarantee can be
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/reference/event-sourcing.html#state-synchronization">relaxed</a>
        for performance reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        eventuate provides two additional important features:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Once persisted it replicates the event to all connected nodes and calls
            the <code>onEvent</code>-handler of all <em>affected</em> eventsourced-actors on all nodes. In this
            case the affected eventsourced actor is an (already active) OrderActor with the same aggregate-id.</li>
        <li>It tracks causality of events, i.e. it ensures that an event that
            <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/user-guide.html#detecting-concurrent-updates"><em>is known</em></a>
            to has
            happened before another event is consumed by all <em>affected</em> actors' <code>onEvent</code>-handler
            before the other event</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The order-view</h2>
    <p>
        Another typical element of eventsourced application are so called
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/reference/event-sourcing.html#event-sourced-views">eventsourced views</a>.
        These are actors that consume events (to build up internal state) but cannot emit any. They
        can be used to implement the query-side of
        a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> based application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderView.scala" class="shortcut">OrderView</a>
        implements a simple example of such an
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/latest/api/index.html#com.rbmhtechnology.eventuate.EventsourcedView">EventsourcedView</a>.
        As it does not define <code>aggregateId</code> it consumes all events that are written to its
        <code>eventLog</code> either directly by eventsourced actors on the same node or through replication.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here the <code>OrderView</code> simply counts for each order its updates
        (i.e. the emitted <code>OrderEvent</code>s) and allows to query for this number by order-id.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Running the example</h2>
    <p>
        On the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a>-tab you can start an example-setup
        with two locations (C and D)
        running in a single JVM in action (main file: <code>sample.eventuate.OrderBot</code>).
        A bot will send commands
        alternating to the <code>OrderManager</code>s of both locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you start it the first time you will see something like this in the log-output:
    </p>
        <pre><code>
( 1) 15:40:16.965 CreateOrderAction$: ------- Send CreateOrder to location-D (1/9) -------
( 1) 15:40:16.966 OrderManager: [D]: Process command: CreateOrder(0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f)
( 2) 15:40:16.966 OrderManager: [D]: Create OrderActor for 0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f
( 3) 15:40:16.971 OrderActor: [D]: OrderCreated: [0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f] items= cancelled=false
( 5) 15:40:16.978 OrderManager: [C]: Create OrderActor for 0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f
( 6) 15:40:16.981 OrderActor: [C]: Initialized from Log: [0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f] items= cancelled=false
( 7) 15:40:19.978 AddOrderItemAction$: ------- Send AddOrderItem to location-C (2/9) --------
( 8) 15:40:19.978 OrderManager: [C]: Process command: AddOrderItem(0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f,Fqmtv)
( 9) 15:40:19.984 OrderActor: [C]: OrderItemAdded: [0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f] items=Fqmtv cancelled=false
(10) 15:40:19.990 OrderActor: [D]: OrderItemAdded: [0762ee15-c570-4c57-8b03-bf757418df9f] items=Fqmtv cancelled=false
        </code></pre>
    <p>
        This shows that:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A <code>CreateOrder</code>-command is sent to D.</li>
        <li>D's <code>OrderManager</code> starts the <code>OrderActor</code>-accordingly.</li>
        <li>The <code>OrderActor</code> emits the <code>OrderCreated</code> event.</li>
        <li>This event gets replicated to location C.</li>
        <li>C's <code>OrderManager</code> sees it and eagerly starts a corresponding <code>OrderActor</code>.</li>
        <li>This <code>OrderActor</code> gets initialized from C's event log
            that already contains the replicated event and thus ends up in the
            same state as D's order.</li>
        <li>After a short pause an <code>AddOrderItem</code>-command for this order is sent to C.</li>
        <li>C's <code>OrderManager</code> dispatches the command to the <code>OrderActor</code>,</li>
        <li>which emits a corresponding <code>OrderItemAdded</code>-event</li>
        <li>The event gets replicated to D und the (already existing) <code>OrderActor</code>
            can consume the same event to bring itself into the same state as C's order.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Concurrent events and conflicts</h2>

    <p>
        Now that you have seen the example application you may wonder what happens if
        an item is added to the same order on both locations C and D simultaneously.
        By tracking causality of events eventuate can detect concurrent events
        and thus potentially conflicting updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can actually try this out by commenting the sleep-statement in
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderBot.scala" class="shortcut">OrderBot</a>
        and running the example again. As the activator UI gives access to a
        limited number of log-lines only, it makes sense to test this using
        sbt started from a terminal. For this execute:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sbt "runMain sample.eventuate.OrderBot"</code></pre>
    <p>
        Depending on your hardware you may need a couple of tries or it might even make sense
        to increase the total number of commands sent to the application (<code>sample.eventuate.Action#total</code>),
        but eventually you should find something like this in the output:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
16:25:59.248 OrderActor: [C]: OrderItemAdded: Conflict:
- version 0: [5f789bc3-9a20-4741-a6c6-dd87cfe36042] items=XN7iM,3hZQO cancelled=false
- version 1: [5f789bc3-9a20-4741-a6c6-dd87cfe36042] items=XN7iM,T6dEy cancelled=false
...
16:25:59.252 OrderActor: [D]: OrderItemAdded: Conflict:
- version 0: [5f789bc3-9a20-4741-a6c6-dd87cfe36042] items=XN7iM,T6dEy cancelled=false
- version 1: [5f789bc3-9a20-4741-a6c6-dd87cfe36042] items=XN7iM,3hZQO cancelled=false
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        In this case the bot added to the order with id 5f789bc3... (which already
        contained item XN7iM) <em>simultaneously</em> the items 3hZQO and T6dEy.
        As the bot actually runs purely sequential, simultaneously in this case means
        the items were added on nodes C and D before the corresponding event was replicated
        to the other location.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/latest/api/index.html#com.rbmhtechnology.eventuate.ConcurrentVersions">ConcurrentVersions</a>
        an actor is able to maintain a
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/user-guide.html#tracking-conflicting-versions">tree of conflicting versions</a>.
        These conflicts can be resolved by a selecting a <em>winner</em>-version either
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/user-guide.html#automated-conflict-resolution">automatically</a>
        or
        <a href="http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate/user-guide.html#interactive-conflict-resolution"><em>interactively</em></a>.
        See the <a href="#tutorial/8" class="shortcut">section</a> on resolving conflicts in the example application for an
        interactive example.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Testing the application</h2>

    <p>
        While seeing the replication and conflict detection in a log-file is nice, you
        would typically want to write automated tests to check correct behaviour of
        the application in these circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
       For this akka comes with the amazing
        <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.3.9/dev/multi-node-testing.html">multi-node-testing-toolkit</a>
        and
        <a href="#code/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderSpec.scala" class="shortcut">OrderSpec</a>
        uses exactly this to verify that the application behaves as expected
        when distributed to two JVMs.
    </p>
    <p>
        A multi-jvm test basically consists out of two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <a href="http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/2.3.10/#akka.remote.testkit.MultiNodeConfig">MultiNodeConfig</a>
            defining the common configuration and the <em>nodes</em> that take part in the test</li>
        <li>A (or several) <a href="http://doc.akka.io/api/akka/2.3.10/#akka.remote.testkit.MultiNodeSpec">MultiNodeSpec</a>(s)
            defining the actual test-logic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <code>MultiNodeConfig</code> <code>TwoNodesReplicationConfig</code> defines two roles
        nodeA and nodeB which are equivalent
        to nodes in the test. Additionally it configures replication properties that
        ensure better timing for testing than the default ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        The actual test-code can be found in <code>OrderSpec</code>. Each test uses the method
        <code>withTwoOrderManagers</code> (implementing the
        <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/sharing_fixtures#loanFixtureMethods">loan-fixture</a>-pattern)
        to get a <code>MultiNodeSpec</code>-reference that sets up the replication for the two nodes
        (running in two JVMs!) and starts an
        <code>OrderManager</code> (on each node). In addition this reference comes with some convenience methods that ease
        testing the <code>OrderManager</code>. The actual test-code comes in the <code>withTwoOrderManagers</code>-block and is
        executed on both JVMs simultaneously.
    </p>
    <h3>Create Orders on both nodes</h3>
    <p>
        The first test simply sends the <code>CreateOder</code>-command to the local <code>OrderManager</code> (on each node)
    </p>
    <pre><code>
executeCommand(CreateOrder(newOrderId))
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        waits for both <code>OrderCreated</code>-events (on each node)
    </p>
    <pre><code>
val emittedEvents = listener.expectMsgAllClassOf(
  List.fill(2)(classOf[OrderCreated]): _*)
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        and verifies (on each node) that the <code>OrderManager</code>s contain both orders
    </p>
    <pre><code>
allOrders shouldBe emittedEvents.map(toOrder).toSet
    </code></pre>
    <h3>Create Order on one node, add item on the other</h3>
    <p>
        The second test creates the order only on node A
    </p>
    <pre><code>
runOn(config.nodeA)(executeCommand(CreateOrder(newOrderId)))
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        waits for the order to be created (on each node)
    </p>
    <pre><code>
val OrderCreated(orderId, _) = waitFor(orderCreated)
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        and adds an item to the order only on node B
    </p>
    <pre><code>
runOn(config.nodeB)(executeCommand(AddOrderItem(orderId, "item")))
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        At the end the <code>OrderManager</code> (on each node) must contain the
        same order.
    </p>
    <h3>Add item on both nodes simultaneously</h3>
    <p>
        The third test finally provokes a conflict by
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>creating an order on nodeA (and waiting for replication)</li>
        <li>disconnecting both nodes (i.e. simulating a network partition)</li>
        <li>adding an order on each node (which creates the conflict)</li>
        <li>connecting the nodes again</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Once the connection is reestablished the added items are replicated to the other node
        and (since they took place concurrently) result in a conflict on each node. At the end the
        test verifies (on each node) that the <code>OrderManager</code> contain both versions
        of the order.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Resolving conflicts</h2>

    <p>
        To demonstrate interactive conflict resolution one can use the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderExample.scala" class="shortcut">OrderExample</a>
        started from a terminal. For this execute in the root-directory of the project (Linux and Mac only):
    </p>
    <pre><code>
./example A B C
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        to start three <em>nodes</em> in three terminal windows on your machine. With
    </p>
    <pre><code>
create Order1
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        in any of the windows you can create an order and see that it gets replicated to all nodes.
        Once that is done you can add an item in another window:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
add Order1 Item1
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Now lets create a partition by stopping node C (Ctrl-C) and add different item in A's and B's
        window:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
(in A:) add Order1 ItemA
(in B:) add Order1 ItemB
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Restart C (Cursor Up + Enter) to re-enable replication and you should see something as
        follows in all windows:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
14:17:46.863 OrderActor: [?]: OrderItemAdded: Conflict:
- version 0: [Order1] items=Item1,ItemA cancelled=false
- version 1: [Order1] items=Item1,ItemB cancelled=false
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The conflict can be resolved with the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
resolve Order1 0
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        To avoid conflicting resolutions the example application implements the rule that a conflict can
        only be resolved on the node that initially created the order. This command sends an
        <code>Resolve(Order1, 0)</code> (defined in the eventuate-library) to the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderManager.scala" class="shortcut">OrderManager</a>
        which in turn forwards it to the corresponding
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/eventuate/OrderActor.scala" class="shortcut">OrderActor</a>.
        When the command can be accepted a corresponding <code>Resolved(Order1, vector-timestamp)</code>
        event is emitted and consumed and processed by all nodes.
